To work on the project, you will need to pull from the remote repository and then install the npm packages specified in the package.json files.

Once for both the backend and frontend folders run $npm install and you should be good to go with the node modules needed. This step may have to be repeated if during the development process the package.json is extended because we are using more packages.

To render the frontend and/or run the backend program open a terminal for the respective folder and use $npm start.

Node installation may also be necessary for those who havent used it, not sure though since it's been a while for me. Let me know if you have issues.
